/// @description Init Points Effect
// This object doesn't actually give points in the original game, this is supposed to be done in one of Sonic's routines.
// This object will instead, simply move upwards, and then fade out and destroy itself

//image_index=1; // For now, leave it at 100. It'll be different as we use different point values.
ysp=-3;        // The speed that the object will move at. This will decrease over time.
