* Set springing up animation to change to walking when ysp >= 0
* See notes on scr_player_acquirefloor (Need to fix animation resetting)
* Finish GHZ objects (Breakable wall, etc)
* Finalize new character palettes and apply them to characters
* Ensure that character animations and functions all work correctly
* Objects that are off screen to deactivate and reset, ala my previous engine
