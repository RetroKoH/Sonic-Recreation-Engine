* See notes on scr_player_acquirefloor (Need to fix animation resetting)
* Finish GHZ objects (Crumbling Ledge, Spiked Log Helix)
* Finalize new character palettes and apply them to characters
* Ensure that character animations and functions all work correctly
* Objects that are off screen to deactivate and reset, ala my previous engine
