GHZ2 and GHZ3 are mp3. Should convert this.

As well, the original Act 1 tracks, along with the non-level music is relatively lower quality.
Not a big deal, but just a note

Double check loop points of music For certain tracks

SMS import music needs to be checked
	Jungle Zone Act 2 (Mushroom Alpha by JX)
	Bonus Stage music needs to be added (Use Bouncy's remix)
	S3K super music needs to be added (Use Bouncy's remix)
